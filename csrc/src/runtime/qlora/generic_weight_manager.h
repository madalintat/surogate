// GenericWeightManager: Architecture-agnostic quantized weight storage and access.
//
// Stores quantized weights in a flat name-based map and provides lazy
// dequantization on access. Works with any quantization format via IQuantizer
// and supports group-based CPU/GPU offloading via OffloadManager.
//
// Usage:
//   1. Create with config and quantizer
//   2. register_weight() or import_and_quantize() to populate
//   3. get() to dequantize and access weights by name
//   4. new_step() at start of each training step to invalidate cache
