# RL Training (GRPO)

Surogate supports reinforcement learning fine-tuning via GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization). The pipeline coordinates a vLLM inference server, a GRPO orchestrator, and the Surogate trainer.

This gives you:

- Surogate's near-SOL training throughput (LoRA, QLoRA, FP8)
- Async RL pipeline (rollouts, reward computation, sample packing)
- vLLM for fast inference and generation
- Optional zero-copy GPU weight sharing between trainer and inference (co-locate mode)
- Training & Evaluation with [Environments](./rl-environments.md)
  
## Architecture

GRPO training supports two deployment modes: **co-locate** (single command, recommended) and **multi-process** (three separate processes).

### Co-locate mode (single command)

The recommended way to run GRPO. A single `surogate grpo` command starts all three components in one process with zero-copy GPU weight sharing:

```
surogate grpo --train train.yaml --infer infer.yaml --orch orch.yaml
```

```

```

**How weight sharing works**: At startup, vLLM loads and quantizes the base model on GPU. The trainer then receives GPU pointers to those quantized tensors via CUDA IPC — no copy, no duplicate memory. Only the base weights (linear layers) are shared; small non-quantized weights (norms, embeddings) are loaded separately from disk. LoRA adapter updates are small (~10 MB) and go through the filesystem.

**Automatic memory management**: The trainer's GPU memory footprint (LoRA parameters, activations, dequantization buffers) is estimated automatically, and `gpu_memory_utilization` is computed so vLLM uses the remaining GPU memory for its KV cache. No manual tuning needed.

### Multi-process mode (three processes)

The original three-process architecture, useful for multi-node setups or when inference and training run on different GPUs:

```
┌─────────────┐    rollouts    ┌──────────────┐    batches    ┌──────────────────┐
│   vLLM      │ ─────────────> │ Orchestrator │ ────────────> │     Trainer      │
└─────────────┘   new weights  └──────────────┘               └──────────────────┘
       ^                                                             │
       └─────────────── weight broadcast (filesystem) ───────────────┘
```

1. **vLLM inference** (`surogate grpo-infer`) generates completions with log-probabilities
2. **Orchestrator** (`surogate grpo-orch`) collects rollouts, computes rewards and advantages, packs samples into training batches
3. **Surogate trainer** (`surogate grpo-train`) performs the policy gradient update and broadcasts updated weights back to vLLM

The three processes communicate via a shared filesystem directory (`output_dir`).

## Quick Start (co-locate mode)

This walkthrough uses the **reverse-text** example — a lightweight task that runs on a single GPU.

### 1. Create the three config files

**`train.yaml`**:

```yaml
model: "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"
output_dir: ./outputs
gpus: 1

per_device_train_batch_size: 1
sequence_len: 2048
max_steps: 40
logging_steps: 1

learning_rate: 2e-4
lr_scheduler_type: constant
max_grad_norm: 1.0
weight_decay: 0.01

recipe: fp8-hybrid

lora: true
lora_rank: 16
lora_alpha: 32
lora_target_modules:
  - q_proj
  - k_proj
  - v_proj
  - o_proj
  - gate_proj
  - up_proj
  - down_proj

loss:
  ratio_type: token
  kl_tau: 0.0
  adv_tau: 1.0
  token_mask_low: 0.125
  token_mask_high: 8.0
  geo_mask_low: 0.1
  geo_mask_high: 10.0
```

**`infer.yaml`**:

```yaml
model: "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"
enable_lora: true
max_lora_rank: 32
```

**`orch.yaml`**:

```yaml
model:
  name: "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"
  lora_adapter: "default"
  lora_rank: 16
  lora_alpha: 32

env:
  - id: reverse-text

batch_size: 128
rollouts_per_example: 16
seq_len: 2048
max_steps: 40

sampling:
  max_tokens: 128
```

### 2. Run with a single command

```bash
surogate grpo --train train.yaml --infer infer.yaml --orch orch.yaml
```

That's it. The command:

1. Starts the vLLM inference server in the background
2. Extracts GPU weight pointers via CUDA IPC for zero-copy sharing
3. Starts the Surogate trainer (borrows vLLM's weights)
4. Runs the orchestrator, which coordinates rollouts and training steps
5. Shuts down cleanly when `max_steps` is reached

You do **not** need to set `gpu_memory_utilization` in co-locate mode — it is computed automatically based on the trainer's memory requirements.

## Quick Start (multi-process mode)

If you prefer separate processes (e.g., inference and training on different GPUs), use the three individual commands:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start vLLM inference server (GPU 0)
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 surogate grpo-infer infer.yaml

# Terminal 2: Start orchestrator (CPU only)
surogate grpo-orch orch.yaml

# Terminal 3: Start Surogate trainer (GPU 1)
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 surogate grpo-train train.yaml
```

The trainer blocks at startup until the orchestrator delivers the first batch. The orchestrator blocks until inference has generated enough rollouts. Once all three are running, the pipeline flows automatically.

### Single-GPU multi-process setup

If you only have one GPU, share it between inference and training. Set `gpu_memory_utilization` in `infer.yaml` to limit vLLM's memory:

```yaml
# infer.yaml
model: "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"
enable_lora: true
gpu_memory_utilization: 0.5
```

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 surogate grpo-infer infer.yaml
surogate grpo-orch orch.yaml
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 surogate grpo-train train.yaml
```

For single-GPU setups, co-locate mode is generally better since it shares base weights and computes memory splits automatically.

## How the Training Loop Works

Each training step performs:

1. **Weight broadcast** (after step > 0): Saves LoRA adapter to `{output_dir}/broadcasts/step_{N}/` with a `STABLE` marker file. vLLM polls for this marker to hot-reload weights. If QeRL is enabled, noisy norm weights are saved alongside the adapter.

2. **Pack and receive batch**: The packer (on master) converts `TrainingBatch` from the orchestrator into packed `MicroBatch` sequences. The data loader delivers these as numpy arrays.

3. **For each micro-batch** (gradient accumulation):
    - `compute_logprobs()` computes log-probabilities under the current policy
    - `compute_grpo_per_token_grads()` computes per-token gradient multipliers using the GRPO loss formula
    - `step_with_custom_loss()` performs the forward + backward pass with GRPO gradient seeding

4. **Optimizer step**: Updates LoRA adapter weights with the configured optimizer and learning rate schedule.

### GRPO Loss Formula

The GRPO loss for each token is:

```
loss = -(coeff * trainer_logprobs)[keep_mask].sum()

where:
  log_ratio = trainer_logprobs - inference_logprobs
  importance_ratio = exp(log_ratio)
  coeff = importance_ratio * (adv_tau * advantages - kl_tau * log_ratio)
```

The coefficient is treated as a constant (detached) during backpropagation, so the per-token gradient is simply:

```
grad[t] = -coeff[t] * keep_mask[t] / loss_scale
```

Tokens are masked (excluded) when their importance ratio falls outside `[token_mask_low, token_mask_high]`, or when sequence-level ratios exceed the geometric or sequence mask thresholds.

## Asynchronous Off-Policy Training

Surogate implements asynchronous off-policy training: inference generates rollouts from a policy that may lag behind the trainer by up to `max_async_level` steps (call this $k$). With $k=1$ and equal trainer/inference step times, neither component idles. The default is `max_async_level: 1`; increase it to `2` when weight broadcasts have higher latency (e.g., over a network).

### Step Semantics

Surogate uses a global step counter $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ to tag all artifacts:

- **Trainer**: Produces policy $\pi_n$ with weights $\theta_n$ from rollouts $(x_n, y_n)$
- **Inference**: Produces rollouts $(x_n, y_n)$ from policy $\pi_{\max(0,\, n-k)}$

The off-policy gap is at most $k$ steps. Rollouts whose gap exceeds `max_off_policy_steps` are discarded by the orchestrator.

### Loss Objective

The loss is a token-level variant of the [AIPO objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24034) (introduced in Llama-RL), without the entropy and KL terms. For $N$ prompts, each with a group of $G$ rollouts:

$$
\mathcal{J}(\theta)
= \frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^N \sum_{i=1}^G |y_i^{(j)}|}
\sum_{j=1}^N
\sum_{i=1}^G
\sum_{t=1}^{|y_i^{(j)}|}
\min\!\left(
\frac{\pi_\theta(y^{(j)}_{i,t}\mid x_j, y^{(j)}_{i,<t})}{\mu(y^{(j)}_{i,t}\mid x_j, y^{(j)}_{i,<t})},\;
\delta
\right)\hat{A}^{(j)}_{i,t}
$$

where $\mu$ is the rollout policy, $\pi_\theta$ is the current trainer policy, $\hat{A}_{i,t}$ is the token-level advantage, and $\delta$ is the importance-sampling clip ratio (`token_mask_high`). The token masking thresholds (`token_mask_low`, `token_mask_high`, `geo_mask_low`, `geo_mask_high`) guard against tokens or sequences with extreme importance ratios caused by the off-policy gap.

## Co-locate Mode Details

### How weight sharing works

In co-locate mode, the base model is loaded only once:

1. vLLM starts first and loads the model (quantized weights go to GPU)
2. The trainer receives GPU pointers to vLLM's quantized tensors via CUDA IPC
3. Both vLLM and the trainer read from the same GPU memory — zero copy, zero duplication
4. Only LoRA adapter updates (~10 MB) are written to disk and reloaded by vLLM

This saves roughly 50% of GPU memory for the base model. For example, a Qwen3-8B model in NF4 takes ~4.5 GB — in co-locate mode this is shared instead of duplicated.

### Automatic gpu_memory_utilization

In co-locate mode, `gpu_memory_utilization` is computed automatically by estimating the trainer's GPU memory needs:

| Component              | Estimate                                                        |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LoRA parameters        | Weight + master copy + gradient + 8-bit optimizer (6 bytes/param) |
| Activations            | Working set (6 BF16 tensors/layer) + logits + residual checkpoints |
| Dequantization buffers | 3 concurrent BF16 buffers (max weight size)                     |
| Embeddings + LM head   | vocab_size * hidden_size * 2 bytes (BF16, loaded from disk)     |
| Fixed overhead         | 2.5 GB (CUDA context, cuDNN workspace, allocator fragmentation) |

The remaining GPU memory (minus a 10% safety margin) is assigned to vLLM. You can override this by setting `gpu_memory_utilization` explicitly in `infer.yaml`.

### Multi-GPU co-locate

Both the trainer and vLLM use data parallelism (`tp=1, dp=N`). Each GPU has a full model replica, and weight sharing is 1:1 per GPU:

```yaml
# train.yaml
gpus: 2

# infer.yaml
dp: 2
```

### Supported quantization formats

Co-locate weight sharing works with all quantization formats since it operates on raw GPU pointers:

- **BnB NF4** — Packed uint8 data + FP32 scales
- **FP8** (E4M3) — FP8 data + FP32 block scales
- **NVFP4** — Packed FP4 data + FP8 scales + FP32 global scale

## QLoRA for RL Training

All QLoRA formats work with GRPO. QLoRA is particularly useful for RL training since it reduces the memory footprint of the frozen base model, leaving more room for the sequence buffers and logprob computations:

```yaml
# FP8 QLoRA (SM89+: RTX 40xx, L40, H100)
lora: true
qlora_fp8: true
recipe: bf16

# NF4 QLoRA (any GPU)
lora: true
qlora_bnb: true
recipe: bf16

# FP4 QLoRA (SM100+: Blackwell)
lora: true
qlora_fp4: true
recipe: nvfp4
```

See [QLoRA guide](qlora.md) for details on each format.

## Multi-GPU RL Training

Multi-GPU training works the same as SFT. Surogate handles data parallelism internally — the trainer presents as a single process to the orchestrator:

```yaml
gpus: 4
zero_level: 1  # Default: shard optimizer states
```

Each micro-batch is replicated across all GPUs. The per-token gradient computation happens on the first GPU's logprobs, and the resulting gradients are replicated for the backward pass.

## Tuning Tips

### QeRL Adaptive Quantization Noise

QeRL (Quantization-enhanced RL, [arXiv:2510.11696](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11696)) adds controlled Gaussian noise to the inference model's RMSNorm weights during rollout generation. This encourages exploration by making the inference policy slightly stochastic, improving reward signal diversity in early training.

#### How it works

1. At each training step, the noise scheduler computes a sigma value based on a geometric decay schedule
2. All RMSNorm weights (input_layernorm, post_attention_layernorm, etc.) are read from the base model
3. Gaussian noise N(0, sigma^2) is added to produce noisy copies
4. The noisy norm weights are applied to vLLM's model before the next rollout batch
5. The trainer always uses the clean (non-noisy) weights for gradient computation

The sigma decays geometrically from `sigma_start` to `sigma_end` over `num_stages` intervals. The first interval uses sigma=0 (no noise) to establish a baseline.

#### Configuration

Add `noise_scheduler` to `train.yaml`:

```yaml
noise_scheduler:
  enabled: true
  sigma_start: 5e-2    # Initial noise level
  sigma_end: 5e-4      # Final noise level
  num_stages: 10        # Number of decay intervals
```

| Parameter     | Default | Description                                     |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`     | `false` | Enable QeRL noise injection                     |
| `sigma_start` | `5e-2`  | Initial noise standard deviation                |
| `sigma_end`   | `5e-4`  | Final noise standard deviation                  |
| `num_stages`  | `10`    | Number of geometric decay intervals             |

#### When to use QeRL

- Models that converge too quickly to a local optimum
- Tasks where reward signal diversity is low (many rollouts get the same reward)
- Pre-quantized models (NVFP4, FP8) where quantization already introduces noise — QeRL amplifies this effect in a controlled way

QeRL works with both co-locate and multi-process modes.

### On-Policy Distillation

On-policy distillation uses a teacher model to provide dense token-level feedback alongside (or instead of) the reward signal. The student generates rollouts, and the teacher's log-probabilities guide the student to stay close to stronger behavior while still learning from rewards.

The loss coefficient for each token becomes:

```
coeff = importance_ratio * (adv_tau * advantages + teacher_tau * (teacher_logprob - trainer_logprob) - kl_tau * log_ratio)
```

The `teacher_tau * (teacher_logprob - trainer_logprob)` term is positive when the teacher assigns higher probability to a token than the student, pulling the student toward the teacher's distribution.

#### Enabling distillation

Set `teacher_tau > 0` in `train.yaml` and configure the teacher in `orch.yaml`. The orchestrator computes teacher log-probabilities and delivers them alongside advantages in each micro-batch — no changes to the trainer command are needed.

**`train.yaml`** — add `teacher_tau` to the loss block:

```yaml
loss:
  ratio_type: token
  adv_tau: 1.0
  teacher_tau: 0.5   # blend: half reward signal, half teacher signal
  kl_tau: 0.0
```

**`orch.yaml`** — add a `teacher_model` section to the orchestrator:

```yaml
model:
  name: "Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B"
  lora_adapter: "default"
  lora_rank: 16

teacher_model:
  model:
    name: "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B"

env:
  - id: reverse-text

batch_size: 128
rollouts_per_example: 16
seq_len: 2048
max_steps: 40
```

If the teacher inference server is already running externally, point to it with a `client` entry instead:

```yaml
teacher_model:
  model:
    name: "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B"
  client:
    base_url: ["http://teacher-server:8000/v1"]
```

#### Pure distillation (no reward verification)

For agentic tasks where verification is expensive (code execution, tool use, multi-turn), skip reward scoring entirely and learn only from the teacher signal:

**`train.yaml`**:

```yaml
loss:
  adv_tau: 0.0       # disable reward signal
  teacher_tau: 1.0   # learn only from teacher
  kl_tau: 0.0
```

**`orch.yaml`**:

```yaml
teacher_model:
  model:
    name: "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B"

buffer:
  skip_verification: true  # skip reward scoring

env:
  - id: your-env
```

#### Monitoring

When teacher log-probabilities are present, the trainer logs an additional metric:

| Metric       | Description                                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `teacher_kl` | Mean KL divergence from teacher to student (lower = closer to teacher) |

A decreasing `teacher_kl` confirms the student is learning to match the teacher's distribution.


### Learning Rate

RL training typically uses a lower learning rate than SFT (5e-7 to 5e-5). Start with `5e-6` and adjust based on the KL divergence metrics.

### Masking Thresholds

The importance ratio masks are critical for training stability:

- **Token masks** (`token_mask_low`/`token_mask_high`): Filter individual tokens with extreme policy drift. The defaults (0.125, 8.0) allow up to 8x ratio before masking.
- **Geometric masks** (`geo_mask_low`/`geo_mask_high`): Filter entire sequences based on the geometric mean of token ratios. Catches sequences where many tokens have drifted moderately.
- If you see high `is_masked_frac` in logs (>50%), your policy is drifting too fast. Reduce the learning rate or increase `kl_tau`.

### KL Penalty

Setting `kl_tau > 0` adds a KL penalty that keeps the policy close to the reference (inference) policy. This prevents reward hacking but slows learning. Start with `kl_tau: 0.0` and increase if the policy diverges.

### Gradient Accumulation

Unlike SFT where gradient accumulation increases effective batch size, in RL training it controls how many packed micro-batches are processed per optimizer step. With `gradient_accumulation_steps: 1` and packed sequences, each step processes one densely-packed sequence.

## Monitoring

The trainer logs these GRPO-specific metrics at each step:

| Metric       | Description                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kl`         | Mean KL divergence between current and inference policy |
| `masked`     | Fraction of loss-eligible tokens that were masked       |
| `tokens`     | Total loss-eligible tokens in the step                  |
| `loss`       | Training loss (from the backward pass)                  |
| `grad_norm`  | Gradient norm after clipping                            |
| `teacher_kl` | KL from teacher to student (only when `teacher_tau > 0`) |

A healthy training run shows:

- `kl` gradually increasing from near-zero (policy is improving)
- `masked` staying below 30-40% (policy isn't drifting too fast)
- `loss` trending downward
- `grad_norm` staying within the clip threshold
