"""Record tag vocabulary and severity levels for debug JSONL output.

Every JSONL record written by a debug subcommand has:
  - tag:      one of :class:`Tag`, determines the record's semantics + field set
  - severity: one of :class:`Severity` (info / warn / error)
  - plus tag-specific structured fields (layer, op, name, shape, stats, ...)

The ``run_id`` is recorded once in the sibling ``.header.json`` sidecar, not on
every row, so bulk tags (HF_KEY, DSL_PARAM, ACT, GRAD, ...) stay compact.

Filtering examples::

    grep '"severity":"error"' debug_*.jsonl
    grep '"tag":"UNBOUND"'    debug_weights_*.jsonl
    jq 'select(.layer==5)'    debug_activations_*.jsonl
    jq 'select(.nan_pct>0)'   debug_activations_*.jsonl
